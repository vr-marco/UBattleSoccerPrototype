UBattleSoccerPrototype
======================

The Unreal Battle Soccer Prototype is an exercise in Behavior Tree development and simple battle mechanics with the Unreal Engine. In its final form this project will be a graphically lightweight online multiplayer game where a human player may join one of two teams, attempt to take control of the ball and kick it into the other team's net.

Behavior tree tasks persist as blueprints, but all other game-specific logic is implemented in C++.
